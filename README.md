# AI for Game of Pig


Game of Pig, originally developped for Prof. Aaron Courville's IFT1015 class, at University of Montreal in the Fall of 2014.

## What it does

The hard-coded strategies taken from http://nifty.stanford.edu/2010/neller-pig/. The AI-strategy was first imagined as a lazy solution to finding a good strategy for the class assignment.
