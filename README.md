Game of Pig, developped for IFT1015 class, at University of Montreal, Fall of 2014

Prof. Aaron Courville
Hard-coded strategies taken from http://nifty.stanford.edu/2010/neller-pig/

# Couple of notes:

AIplayer was first imagined after not having enough inspiration to find the best strategy
The code works entirely as functions, no OOP (to stay true to my Fall 2014 knowledge)
Original code was lost, but was in JS (according to school language of choice fot IFT1015 class)
